# 30 problems on the hackerrank
1) Hello world
--------------
   - easy problem
   - understanding cout,cin in the programme

2) Datatype Problem
-------------------
   - understanding of the double type input , string input
   - double has the precision of more than one after pointer
   - constraint of the ' cin >> ' in taking input(in strings) / overcome with getline(cin,inputvariable)

   getline() reads the input string
   . line by line
   . read space too
   . stores in the inputvariable
   . ' cin >> ' then stores the inputvariable in " main () " function

3) Operators problem
--------------------
   - understanding the use of operators , mathematical
   - void function is defined
   - understanding the use of  ' cin.ignore() ' , it clears the buffer of input stream
    " What is the input Buffer ? "
     Ans : A temporary storage area/space in RAM is called buffer.When input is taken by the ' cin ' input container ,
           it is not directly sent to "RAM" t rather "OS" [ as temp storage in RAM ].
           Our objective is to send 'right input' in 'right container' to process by CPU .Thus to neglect inter-mixing
           of the input buffer , we use 'cin.ignore()'

           Story: when any "input" is given to processor it acts as "interruption" to the processor .
                  Processor sets priority to every "input" thus , storing it in temporary space of the "RAM".
                  The right block to get processed in right time , we need to make sure the "input" goes to right
                  buffer space of the "RAM".
